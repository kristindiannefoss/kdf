            My group for this project created an app with React.js that uses a firebase server. Challenges included breaking the functionality into components and passing state and props appropriately. <br><br> We used lodash and moment libraries in our JavaScript and node webpack, and we tested with Enzyme and Chai. The design was done for us and we were tasked with matching the spec pixel to pixel and making the app responsive for mobile.

We created it to learn more about JavaScript and Node.js.  <br><br>The object of the game is to clear all off the pictures of the puzzle in each level by clicking the green squares. I created the styling and design for the game and contributed to the back end functionality.

            This Rails application is a microdonation site our group created in the third quarter of the program. A user can create an account and donate available items to multiple recipients. <br><br>A donation recipient is an admin user for their own store, they can select predetermined needs from the catalog to request specific donations. A master admin user can edit information with recipients and donors. The code is pivoted off of a previous e-commerce site to practice working in existing code bases and multi-tenancy.

          My education in Interior Design has given me a foundation for understanding the elements and principles of all types of design.  While I enjoy good interior design, it became clear that I was more skilled and interested in using the digital tools of the trade than working as a practicing designer.  The design education, as well as professional experience working with clients, acting as a go between with lead designers and contracters, and the hands on business knowlege have helped color my career trajectory.

          While I never pursued a career directly related to my Psychology Degree, the study of behavior and cognition is something I have been able to apply.  The program included statistics classes as well as psychological studies.  I find my understanding of User Experience to be directly related to what I learned in this program.

          'Among other things, psychologists study the most effective ways to deal with others and how humans can best adapt to change, stress and a variety of other situations that are a part of daily living. Major subfields within the discipline include human cognition, emotion, behavior, social interactions and mind­brain relationships.'

            <br><br>
            I’m a passionate programmer and a lover of life.  I’ve been told I am a decent human being and not terrible to be around.  Love laughing, travel, health food, and animals.  I’m determined to live like I mean it.
